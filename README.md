# Code Editor Web App

This is a web-based code editor that allows you to write and edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate panels. You can see the live result of your code in the preview panel. The application is built using React.

## Features

- **Separate Panels:** The code editor is divided into three separate panels for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to work on each part of your project.

- **Copy Functionality:** You can copy the code from each panel individually, allowing you to copy just the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript portion as needed.

- **Lock/Unlock Panels:** You can lock and unlock each panel individually. Locking a panel prevents further edits in that specific code section.

- **Preview:** The application provides a live preview of your code in an iframe, so you can see the result as you type.
